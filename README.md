**Samachi is the global VIP network; a "Gympass for clubs, resorts & festivals worldwide.**

Imagine tapping into exclusive venue experiences, managing your memberships effortlessly, and connecting with like-minded individuals â€“ all starting with a simple scan of your membership card. Samachi makes this a reality.

We leverage RFID/NFC enabled membership cards with QR code technology for instant onboarding, Supabase for robust user & venue data management, and direct integration with venue systems (via the Glownet API) to provide real-time membership status and benefits. Utilizing Solana blockchain's fast, cheap and secure infrastructure for crypto-asset staking that enables a novel VIP, "restuarant-style" payment experience - Samachi aims to create a global network of festivals, clubs and resorts; the "Solana Social Layer".

## Core Features & Vision

*   **Unified Profile:** Manage your profile, linked memberships across different venues, and on-chain + closed-loop assets all in one place.
*   **Real-time Venue Integration:** Connect directly with venue systems to:

    ```ini
    # .env.local

    # Supabase
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<public_URL_for_your_Supabase_DB>
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... # Keep Secret!

    # Redirect URL used by Supabase - http://localhost:3000 is the default dev URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

    # Glownet - Development
    GLOWNET_API_BASE_URL=https://opera.glownet.com/organization
    GLOWNET_API_KEY=... # Optional for judges

    TREASURY_WALLET_SECRET_KEY=<wallet_secret_key>
    USDC_MINT_ADDRESS=<token_minting_address> # Devnet USDC Mint Address
    
    # Helius
    HELIUS_API_KEY=... # Add if you plan to use the Helius SDK directly later, not strictly needed for webhook secret verification
    HELIUS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
    ```
4.  **Database:** Ensure Supabase tables are set up (use `supabase/migrations` and `supabase db push` if available, or set up manually).
